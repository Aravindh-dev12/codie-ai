### AI Code Generation

The platform leverages Google's Generative AI to:

1. Understand natural language requirements
2. Generate optimized, production-ready code
3. Provide code explanations and documentation
4. Offer suggestions for improvements

```javascript
// AI code generation workflow
const GenerateAiCode = async () => {
  // Prepare user requirements as a prompt
  const PROMPT = JSON.stringify(messages) + " " + Prompt.CODE_GEN_PROMPT;
  
  // Send to AI service
  const result = await axios.post("/api/gen-ai-code", { prompt: PROMPT });
  const aiResp = result.data;

  // Merge AI-generated files with defaults
  const mergedFiles = { ...Lookup.DEFAULT_FILE, ...aiResp?.files };
  
  // Update workspace with generated code
  await UpdateFiles({
    workspaceId: id,
    files: aiResp?.files,
  });
  
  // Handle token consumption
  updateUserTokens(aiResp);
};
```
